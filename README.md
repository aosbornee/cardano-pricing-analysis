# Cardano Pricing Analysis

## The Context

You are a Data analyst working for a project built on the ADA ecosystem

As the team want to be in the know of the price movement of ADA, you have been tasked with displaying historical data in a way which is

- Easy to view
- Easy to make financial decisions

You will notice that I have written some things, but I didn't have enough time to complete the project

## The Steps

1. Take this repository and clone it to your local machine, so that you can access the files that I have already started to create

- To do this, you will need to have git installed, watch this [video]("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjZcfj8yxE) on why we use git and how to download

2. Use the requests library to fetch historical price data of Cardano using the Coin Gecko API

- Sign up for a demo account to get an API key [here]("https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/pricing")
- Find the /coins/{id}/history API endpoint in the [API docs]("https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/documentation")

3. From the return of the API call, try to find the _symbol_ property and assign it to the _cardano_symbol_ variable

4. When you are finished, make sure to **push** your code to Github
